	<h1>My Cat</h1>
		<h2>Schmuck origin:</h2>
		<p>Schmuck was picked up from a farm about 5 years ago, and we became best friends
		ever since. 
		He is the most affectionate cat ever. He loves to cuddle everyone and 
		welcomes any stranger who comes his way.
		He loves treats and being picked up. 
		He especially loves to carry socks around the house in the middle of the night.
		Sometimes he meows just a little too much, but we wouldn't trade him for the world. 
		</p>
